# SantaClausThread

Working with Java Threads, this is a project for school.
To create Threads:
-2 classes (BadChild and GoodChild) extend abstract class Child, they implement Runnable interface
-1 class (Elf) extends class Thread

There are N_SC number of Santa Claus in the Christmas market ready for the children and the elfs are doing ther job without working with Santa Claus.
